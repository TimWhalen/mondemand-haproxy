Generic and configurable script to create mondemand metrics from haproxy statistics
Not very usable unless you already understand mondemand, but if you want to
run this you need mondemand-tool and this installed.

See http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.6/doc/management.txt for a list of haproxy 1.6 statistics.
